# ProTherm

ProTherm is a collection of numerical data of thermodynamic parameters such as Gibbs free energy change, enthalpy change, heat capacity change, transition temperature etc. for wild type and mutant proteins, that are important for understanding the structure and stability of proteins. It also contains information about secondary structure and accessibility of wild type residues, experimental conditions (pH, temperature, buffer, ion and protein concentration), measurements and methods used for each data, and activity information (Km and Kcat ).

# ProNIT
ProNIT database provides experimentally determined thermodynamic interaction data between proteins and nucleic acids. It contains the properties of the interacting protein and nucleic acid, bibliographic information and several thermodynamic parameters such as the binding constants, changes in free energy, enthalpy and heat capacity. For more details, please see About ProNIT. ProNIT current release, ProNIT 2.0, contains 7970 entries. Since we have deleted some data and have carried out major modifications, the entries of database are renumbered. We have provided a Mapping table, which relates the old and new entry numbers, to help the users.
